By incorporating owner demographics, particularly factors like income level and household size, we can extend our analysis of the distribution of licensed pets across different geographic regions. For example, correlating demographic data with pet ownership patterns can help identify trends such as higher prevalence of certain breeds in areas with higher household incomes. Specific to my guiding questions I would have liked to see if larger or smaller sized dogs were more popular and how owner demographics played a role."

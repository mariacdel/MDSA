    "\n",
    "- You may discuss the problems in this assignment with other students in this course and your instructor/TA, but YOUR WORK MUST BE YOUR OWN.\n",
    "- Do not show other students code or your own work on this assignment.\n",
    "- You may consult external references, but not actively receive help from individuals not involved in this course.\n",
    "- Cite all references outside of the course you used, including conversations with other students which were helpful. (This helps us give credit where it is due!). All references must use a commonly accepted reference format, for example, APA or IEEE (or another citation style of your choice).\n",

    "We suggest completing this assignment using the provided notebook. Each question should be answered using a SQL query (or combination or SQL queries) unless the text indicates that you may (or should) do something else. You may submit your queries embedded in Python, using SQLAlchemy or the MySQL Connector, or as plain text in Markdown.\n",

Overall, MongoDB can be faster than SQL if the data is appropriately indexed. Additionally, MongoDB is well-suited for handling hierarchical data. The more nested the data becomes, the more I would lean towards using MongoDB over SQL. Personally, I prefer SQL simply because I have more practice with it, but I believe MongoDB could become easier with more practice."

At the start of the course, I had little knowledge about SQL, but now I feel comfortable writing queries and comprehending database concepts. The assignments in DATA 604, particularly assignment three, played a crucial role in my learning. Assignment three focused on SQL joins, which was initially challenging for me. However, through hands-on practice I gained a deeper understanding of joins and their applications. Looking ahead, I aim to continue developing my SQL skills through real-world application. The datasets used in assignment three are coincidentally the same ones used in our group's final project. Leveraging the techniques learned in assignment three, I feel more confident about integrating multiple datasets and extracting insights for our final project. Additionally, exploring advanced SQL functionalities like subqueries and window functions will further enhance my proficiency in data analysis. Continued practice, exposure to diverse datasets, and collaborative projects will be essential for advancing my understanding of SQL and database management."
